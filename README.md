•Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a mobile app game which is very successful on Android. The client wanted to expand its game creation and have it on multiple platforms.

•What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe that I did well with the reccomendations’ portion. This will be very helpful because it can help the client. I made sure to let them know that the cloud platform is better.

•What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It helps organize the ideas and know what needs to be done. When it comes to actually doing it, you already know the standards you will need to meet.

•If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that I could have done a better job with the evaluation part. I do not think I did too well with. The comparing and contrasting.

•How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to keep in mind the user’s needs. The user is what it is all about. When designing, you need to think as the user to make sure that things are being done in a well matter.

•How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Strategies would be to organize yourself and ideas and know what needs to be done. From there you will pick how to do it and decide which way is best.
